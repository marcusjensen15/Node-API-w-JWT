This is a basic protected API using JWT. To start the server, run 'npm start'.

In order to make requests to this api, you are going to need to login via the api/user/register route. Marcus left a stickynote on his computer with his login creds.

If you want to access posts, you need to do a 'get' request to 'api/posts'. You will need to paste your JWT token into the header of the request: key value pair:

auth-token (insert auth-token)
